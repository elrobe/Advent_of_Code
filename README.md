# Advent of Code

## Summary

For-fun repository filled with Eli's attempts at solving [Advent of Code](www.adventofcode.com) problems.

To approach each problem, I try to use a different language, though not necessarily the best language suited to the task at hand. This is more to practice with multiple languages. For example, [2022 Day 15's solution](./2022/15/solution.clj) made me seriously regret using Clojure as it would have been significantly easier with a language like Python.

Each solution file contains two main parts:
- File reading and parsing, "input.txt"
- The solution to the problem at hand

Also, note that the solution directories also provide "sample_input.txt". This is the input provided by the problem statement for testing purposes.
